                        <p>Growing up, I never quite knew what I wanted to do when I get older. I had a lot of interests, but couldn't pin point what I would enjoy doing for a lifetime. So at 20 years old I joined the Navy. I knew I needed to get out and see the world, find my passion and interests. My rating (job) while I was in the Navy was a diesel mechanic. This wasn't my dream job by any means, but there were parts of it that I absolutely loved, the main being the challenge of putting together a puzzle and fixing issues. I was good at taking a schematic and going through checklists until I found the problem. I didn't, however, love the physical grind of being a mechanic. After the Navy, I went off to college and thought I had it figured out. I would become a music business professional. I love music, and grew up going to shows and concerts almost every weekend. Surely this was what I was meant to do. Not quite. I then transitioned to media management. I thought for a few years this was it, I found my career, but the last year of college changed that. I moved into an apartment with a friend that I had met a little earlier in college. He was a computer science major. He would show me some of his school work all the time and I found it so fascinating. It looked challenging... like a puzzle. He showed me a lot and I even learned a little on my own for fun. Fast forward 3 years and I was in Sales and looking for something more. I didn't enjoy my job. I again started messing around with programming, and again loved learning it. I wanted to figure out how I could learn more and do it as a career. So I looked online... Enter Nashville Software School. Here was my blueprint to becoming a developer. </p>
